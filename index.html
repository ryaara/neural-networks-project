Much of modern climate change research is built on Earth system models 
(ESMs), bottom-up simulations of future climate activity based on the 
laws of physics and other physical boundary conditions. These models are essential to
creating environmental policy and climate-resilient infrastructure; if we cannot predict 
the ways in which climate change will impact different regions of the world, then we will 
be unable to protect those who will be impacted. However, despite their importance and 
heavy use, these models suffer from significant forecast inaccuracies and often struggle 
to adequately predict the speed at which climate change is impacting the modern world 
(which, in turn, could delay human adaptation to this crisis). [1]

Fortunately, the AI industry has begun to develop solutions. In recent years, 
climate scientists have begun to adapt deep neural networks (DNNs) in order to more 
efficiently synthesize large climatic datasets and, in turn, accurately predict the 
environmental consequences of climate change. Many industry experts hope that DNNs will be 
able to approach climate modeling from the top-down, rather than the ground-up, which will 
make them more capable of adapting to the novel environmental conditions brought about by 
climate change and more able to utilize large modern atmospheric datasets to analyze climate 
trends. [2] One recent project, for instance, trained a DNN on global temperature data and 
then used the system to forecast near-future temperature dynamics. They discovered that 
their model was able to accurately predict temperature changes when fed test data from the 
previous century and suggest that this tool can be a reliable supplement to cover the blind 
spots of ESMs. [3]

This project, which hopes to develop a neural network capable of predicting regions that will 
be impacted by drought, was motivated by these recent research successes. More specifically, I hope 
to produce a neural network that can take in several environmental datapoints (e.g. rainfall, temperature)
and accurately predict whether the described region is at risk of experiencing a near-future drought. Much 
of this project will likely be spent training the model with previous environmental data labeled as from a 
drought-impacted region of not. Several similar projects have been completed and, despite differences in the 
trained datasets and outputs, I'd expect to use that research as the foundation that this project builds 
upon. [3, 4] If successful, I'd hope to publish a conference paper (or similar) with this project.

<ol>
    <li> Develop a DNN and utilize supervised learning to train it on a dataset consisting of vectors 
        containing environmental information (long-term rainfall, recent temperatures, etc.) and a label 
        determining whether or not that data was collected from a region experiencing drought.
    <li> Test the above DNN and, ultimately, develop a model capable of providing reasonably accurate predictions 
        about a region's risk of drought.
    <li> If our initial work is successful, increase the model's complexity by introducing additional inputs or 
        increasing the training datasize to result in a more accurate system.
    <li> In the longer term (and, again, assuming some degree of success), produce a paper outlining our work.
